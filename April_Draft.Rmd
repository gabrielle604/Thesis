## Load the data
```{r}
NHANES <- read_csv(here("cleaned_data","NHANES.csv"))
```


## The svydesign function
Before we can start our analyses, we need to use the svydesign function from the "survey" package written by Thomas Lumley. The svydesign function tells R about the design elements in the survey. Once this command has been issued, all that needs to be done for the analyses is use the object that contains this information in each command. Because the 2001-2016 NHANES data were released with a sampling weight (wtint2yr), a PSU variable (sdmvpsu) and a strata variable (sdmvstra), we will use these our svydesign function.

```{r}
nhc <- svydesign(id=~SDMVPSU, weights=~WTINT2YR,strata=~SDMVSTRA, nest=TRUE, survey.lonely.psu = "adjust", data=NHANES)
nhc
```


## We can get additional information about the sample, such as the number of PSUs per strata, by using the summary function.
```{r}
summary(nhc)
```










## Boxplots, bivariate analyses
```{r}
# change the noNAs dataset with each boxplot I create:
## one for: refED age gender ethnicity fpl citizenship

noNAs = NHANES %>% filter(!is.na(citizenship)) %>% filter(!is.na(monoEthyl))
                                                                                                            

box_citizenship <- ggplot(data = noNAs, design=nhc,
                      aes(x=log(monoEthyl), y=citizenship, fill=citizenship)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="PuBuGn") +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=12)) +
  xlab("(logged) Mono-Ethyl Phthalate Level (ng/mL)") +
  ylab("Participant Citizenship Status") +
ggtitle("Participant Citizenship Status and Logged Phthalate Level")


box_citizenship
```
We can make barcharts. In the example below, we also preview some syntax used for subpopulation analysis.
```{r}
barplt<-svyby(~log(monoEthyl)+RIDAGEYR, ~gender, nhc, na = TRUE, svymean)
barplot(barplt,beside=TRUE,legend=TRUE)
```
## We can break the boxplot by a grouping variable. The grouping variable must be a factor.
```{r}
svyboxplot(~log(monoEthyl)~factor(gender), nhc, all.outliers=TRUE)
```
## Instead of the density on the y-axis, we can request the count.  Notice the large count of respondents in the last column on the right.  The coding of the ridageyr variable explains this.
```{r}
svyhist(~RIDAGEYR, nhc, probability = FALSE)
```











## REORDER year
```{r}
NHANES$year <- factor(NHANES$year, ordered = TRUE)
NHANES$year
```

## Boxplots, bivariate analyses --- year
```{r}
# change the noNAs dataset with each boxplot I create:
## one for: refED age gender ethnicity fpl citizenship

noNAs = NHANES %>% filter(!is.na(year)) %>% filter(!is.na(monoEthyl))
                                                                                                            

box_year <- ggplot(data = noNAs, design=nhc,
                      aes(x=log(monoEthyl), y=year, fill=year)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="PuBuGn") +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=12)) +
  xlab("(logged) Mono-Ethyl Phthalate Level (ng/mL)") +
  ylab("Year of Participant Survey") +
ggtitle("Year of Participant Survey and Logged Phthalate Level")

box_year
```










## ADULTS Subpopulation Analysis
```{r}
subset_adult <- subset(nhc, RIDAGEYR >= 19)

# create an adult NHANES file
names(NHANES)

NHANES %>% filter(RIDAGEYR>=19) -> only_adults
```


### What is missing?
```{r}
vis_miss(only_adults, sort_miss = TRUE)
```


### Model for Adults
```{r}
model_adult <- svyglm(log(monoEthyl)~age+gender+ethnicity+fpl+citizenship+adultED+year, design=subset_adult, na.action = na.omit)

summ(model_adult)

summ(model_adult, robust = "HC1") #robust standard errors 

summ(model_adult, confint = TRUE, digits = 3) #In many cases, youâ€™ll learn more by looking at confidence intervals than p-values. You can request them from summ. default is 95% CIs

summ(model_adult, confint = TRUE, pvals = FALSE) #DROP the p values all together

# THE GRAPH
plot_summs(model_adult)
plot_summs(model_adult, inner_ci_level = .95)
plot_summs(model_adult, robust = TRUE)

# plot coefficient uncertainty as normal distributions
plot_summs(model_adult, plot.distributions = TRUE, inner_ci_level = .95)

# table output for Word and RMarkdown documents

# confidence intervals instead of standard errors

```

## ANOVA
This is an example of a Kruskal Wallis test, which is the non-parametric analog of a one-way ANOVA.

Null Hypothesis (H0): All ranks are equal (no difference in medians) 
Alternative Hypothesis (HA): At least two ranks differ (at least one difference in group medians)

Tests whether samples are originated from the same distribution.
The ANOVA (and t-test) is explicitly a test of equality of means of values. The Kruskal-Wallis (and Mann-Whitney) can be seen technically as a comparison of the mean ranks

NOTE: the "Chisq" is actually the H Statistic

kwtest <- svyranktest(monoEthyl~adultED, design = nhc, na = TRUE, test=("KruskalWallis"))

## Descriptive statistics table: ADULTS

## Collinearity of reference person education and adult participant education
```{r}
model <- lm(log(monoEthyl)~age+gender+ethnicity+fpl+citizenship+adultED+refED+year, design=subset_adult, data = only_adults)
ols_coll_diag(model)
# how do I interpret that ^^^ ???

## another approach
### standard errors tend to inflate (get bigger) when there are collinear variables
summary(lm(log(monoEthyl)~age+gender+ethnicity+fpl+citizenship+adultED+year, design=subset_adult, data = only_adults))

summary(lm(log(monoEthyl)~age+gender+ethnicity+fpl+citizenship+adultED+refED+year, design=subset_adult, data = only_adults))
# coefficients for adultED go down when refED added into the model
```

## We can confirm that they are relatively highly correlated
```{r}
model.matrix(~0+., data=only_adults) %>% 
  cor(use="pairwise.complete.obs") %>% 
  ggcorrplot(show.diag=FALSE, type="lower", lab=TRUE, lab_size=2)
# ^that's crazy looking. let's simplify it
```

## Only looking at correlation between adult participant education and household head education

If you want to have a genuine correlation plot for factors or mixed-type, you can also use model.matrix to one-hot encode all non-numeric variables. This is quite different than calculating CramÃ©r's V as it will consider your factor as separate variables, as many regression models do.

You can then use your favorite correlation-plot library. I personally like ggcorrplot for its ggplot2 compatibility.
